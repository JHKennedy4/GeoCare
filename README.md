An application for crowd sourcing data on food availability, and mapping food deserts.

The goal is for this application to host food availability data for the entire nation, but currently development work is being done with data from Monroe County, NY.

Feel free to go to http://www.snapretailerlocator.com/ to download the data directly from the USDA.

SNAP Data for Monroe County is available at CartoDB: http://cdb.io/XVChAg

To run this locally, follow the link to CartoDB, and download the data. Then, create an account, and upload the data you downloaded.

Create a secret.js file from the template using your username and api key. Your api key can be found by clicking on your username at the top right of CartoDB.

You can see app live at http://food-desert-mapper.herokuapp.com.
